## Mod Features

#### Dead Coral and Coral Fans Erode into Sand ####

Provides additional *Sand* and *Red Sand*

Disable with ```/skyblock removeDefault coralErosion```

Dead Coral and Dead Coral Fans with water flowing out of them will spawn Sand every few seconds.
Fire versions spawn Red Sand instead.

The Coral has a 3% chance to break after spawning Sand.

Infinitely automatic farms are possible, but not trivial.

This method was added because:

- Getting Sand purely from the Wandering Trader is not sufficient.
- Gravity block duping and Trader multi-use bugs are unintended and could be fixed at any time.
- The old method where Husks dropped Sand is boring as it's just another standard mob farm.

#### Vexes Can Be Allayed ####

Provides *Allays*

Disable with ```/skyblock removeDefault renewableAllays```

Play Vexes the right sequence of 5 Note Block notes to convert them to Allays.

Vexes listen to Note Blocks within a 16 block range and emit particles based on whether the correct note is played. The
instrument is ignored and the octave is ignored, meaning F#<sub>3</sub> is treated the same as F#<sub>5</sub>.

When a Vex is in a Minecart, a Comparator can be used with a Detector Rail to determine the next note in the sequence.
The Comparator outputs a value from 0 (corresponding to F#) to 11 (corresponding to F)
